#### `transpose(input: Array)`

**param** `input` A matrix to transpose. Should be square.

**returns: Array** - A matrix that is the transpose of `input`. Note to do a transpose one must have a square matrix (2d)

This function simply gives the transpose of the `input` matrix, which should be a two-dimensional, square matrix: (recall a transpose is the rows and columns switched)
