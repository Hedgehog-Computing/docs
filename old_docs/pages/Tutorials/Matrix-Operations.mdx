# Matrix Operations

## Basic Matrix Operations

There are a few basic operations in Linear Algebra. We will also cover some basic functions we have in Hedgehog Lab and how to use them.

    ## Matrix Addition {"\\(\A+B\\)"}
    
    For an {"\\(m\\times n\\)"} matrix {"\\(A\\)"} and an {"\\(m\\times n\\)"} matrix {"\\(B\\)"} , the sum of the matrices, {"\\(C = A\+ B\\)"} is defined such that
    {"\\(C\_{ij} = A\_{ij}\+\B\_{ij}\\)"} 

    ## Matrix Product {"\\(AB\\)"}

    For an {"\\(m\\times n\\)"} matrix {"\\(A\\)"} and an {"\\(n\\times p\\)"} matrix {"\\(B\\)"} , the product, {"\\(C = AB\\)"} is defined as a {"\\(m\times p\\)"}
    such that {"\\(C\_{ij}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\A\_{ik}\+\B\_{kj}\\)"} for {"\\(i = 1,2,\\dots, m\\)"} and {"\\(j = 1,2,\\dots, p\\)"}.
