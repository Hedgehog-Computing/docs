#  Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of Hedgehog Lab is JavaScript/Typescript with added functions and properties from our libraries. We've seen the syntax for Variables, Strings, Functions, Classes, the Mat object and Control Flow (`if` statements, `for` loops, etc..)

Let us consider some special objects, functions and utilities in Hedgehog Lab:

## Tensors

Tensors are a more complicated mathematical structure, but can simply be viewed as **multi-dimensional arrays**. Below is an example of declaring a tensor, in two different ways, giving a raw JavaScript input and using the `Tensor` object. Note that only providing the Tensor instance lets you access important properties such as 'shape' which can be viewed similarly to 'rows' and 'cols' of a Matrix. Overall, tensors are generalizations of matrices.

Some other properties and functions of Tensors include but are not limited to, using `val` to transform it to a JavaScript array again in a similar fashion. We have `flatten(x)` which takes a multi-dimensional array (tensor) and reduces it to a 1-dimensional JavaScript array. `ndim(x)` gives the dimension of the vector, for example **all** 2-d matrices are of dimension 2. This is useful for differentiating between a scalar, vector, matrix and tensor. There are many other functions that support tensor calculations such as, `dot_divide`, `dot_multiply`, `factorial`, `ones`, `zeros`, `power`, and so on... see the function reference at the end of the book for details. 

Other than Tensors, we will cover all other topics in the tutorials. All basic syntax so far has been covered, overall just understand that everything is in Typescript!
